Counting Valleys

Gary is an avid hiker. He tracks his hikes meticulously, paying close attention to small details like topography.
During his last hike he took exactly  steps. For every step he took, he noted if it was an uphill "U" or a downhill
"D" step. Gary's hikes start and end at sea level and each step up or down represents a unit change in altitude.
We define the following terms:
    A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and
    ending with a step down to sea level.
    A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and
    ending with a step up to sea level.

the client any notifications until they have at least that trailing number of prior days' transaction data.

We consider two strings to be anagrams of each other if the first string's letters can be rearranged to form the second
string. In other words, both strings must contain the same exact letters in the same exact frequency. For example,

Sherlock and the Valid String

Sherlock considers a string to be valid if all characters of the string appear the same number of times.
It is also valid if he can remove just 1 character at 1 index in the string, and the remaining characters
will occur the same number of times. Given a string s, determine if it is valid. If so, return YES, otherwise return NO.

For example, if s = 'abc', it is a valid string because frequencies are {a : 1, b : 1, c : 1}. So is s = 'abcc' because we
can remove one c and have 1 of each character in the remaining string.

Ex.
'xxxaabbccrry' -> NO
'aabbcd' -> NO
'aabbc' -> YES

Special String Again

A string is said to be a special palindromic string if either of two conditions is met:
    All of the characters are the same, e.g. aaa.
    All characters except the middle one are the same, e.g. aadaa.
A special palindromic substring is any substring of a string which meets one of those criteria. Given a string,
determine how many special palindromic substrings can be formed from it.
Ex. s = 'abcbaba' n = 7 result is 10

A man desires to make a ransom not from a magazine. Don't ask me why.
Given the words in the magazine and the words in the ransom note, return true if he can replicate his
ransom note exactly using whole words from the magazine; otherwise, return false
The words in his note are case-sensitive and he must use only whole words available in the magazine.
He cannot use substrings or concatenation to create the words he needs.

Two Strings

Given two strings, determine if they share a common substring. A substring may be as small as one character.

For example, the words "a", "and", "art" share the common substring a. The words "be" and "cat" do not share a substring.
Ex.
str_1 = 'hello', str_2 = 'world' would print 'YES'
str_1 = 'hi', str_2 = 'world' would print 'NO'
